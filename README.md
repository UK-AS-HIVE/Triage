Triage
==
##Overview##
Triage is a Meteor.js application for ticket tracking and management. Triage is intended to provide ticket tracking grouped by distinct 'queues', which serve to separate issues in a multi-team environment.

##Usage##
Triage uses LDAP for user authentication as well as permissions. LDAP settings, queues, and email settings need to be defined in settings.json. An example is provided in the repository.
